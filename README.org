#+TITLE: Python Scheme Interpreter

* Scheme interpreter in Python
This was a proof of concept for me, where I worked on implementing a subset of [[http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/][R5RS]] the Scheme specification. This work is based on the blog post by Peter Norvig which can be found here: http://norvig.com/lispy.html 

To run use:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python calc.py
#+END_SRC
